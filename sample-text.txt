Kirby's Epic Yarn - First Cutscene Script

Welcome to Dream Land, a kingdom famous for peace and quiet.

It's the perfect little place... if you like that sort of thing.

Lately there have been rumours of a caped sorcerer goiing around
turning people into yarn! That's right... Yarn.

One day... Kirby saw his favourite food, a bright red tomato, on
top of a bush.

"I bet it's yummy!"

But when Kirby tried to eat it, a caped sorcerer appeared!

"My name is-- Hey! What are you doing?! Stop that!"

"No! That's my magic Metamato!"

Kirby gulped the Metamato right down!

Just then, a white sock around the sorcerer's neck began to glow... 
Then it sucked Kirby up!

"...This grass feels funny," Kirby thought. "It feels like... trousers."

And to Kirby's surprise... He saw that his entire body was made out of yarn!

Then, he saw a yarn monster chasing a blue yarn boy!

"Somebody help me!"
